# hydra-openvino-sensors
This is the core jupyter directory to control all the sensors in the framework
After training and Optimizing the Computer Vision Object Detection Model, I have published my project on 
Hackster.io  
 - Hydra: OpenVino Computer Vision and IoT based Remote Plant Monitoring along with Geo Spatial Data Analysis

This project leverages the power of edge Computer Vision computing using OpenVino Model Optimization and Intel NCS2 Video Processing for high end data processing. This project uses the Video Processing Units Provided on the Intel NCS2 to deploy models with large dataset on Edge!

This project utilizes the OpenVino model Optimiser to optimise the Apple Plant Disease Detection model with a large dataset and deploy the Model on a Raspberry Pi as a core computing unit. Besides this, there are different sensors to gather other data from the Plants

Using Data collected from sensors as well as Video data, classification and Processing of the data takes place and finally it's used for Geo spatial Analysis and Visualisation of Timely Trends in Data of the Apple Plant performance
